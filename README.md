# languages_anki

This is a repo to create decks for languages using Anki.

## 625 words

Data base with the translations of the 625 meaningful words most commonly used (there actually less than 625 words), it includes images (+ file with the images) and translations to Spanish and Portuguese.

## decks_json

It includes json files (currently 1) with the info for the Anki deck, created using the add-on "CrowdAnki".

> This file does NOT include media, so it should be downloaded from the media file (file with the images)

## Things to do

- Link the names of the images in the data set with the images in the media file
- Check that the Spanish translation is right, and then check the translation to Portuguese (from Spanish and/or English)
- Compare the original list of words with the data set and fix the problems (e.g. similar words like "speak/say")
- Deal with numbers like 22, 34, 41, etc.
- Include images for numbers like third, fourth, etc.
- Improve the images
- Deal with missing images and words with different meanings

## General plan

1. Create flashcards for basic vocabulary (625 words)
2. Learn some of basic grammar (probably without Anki)
3. Create sentence cards
3. Create flashcards for sentences
4. Improve what you want: more vocabulary, read audio books, write, watch videos or movies, speak, etc. Finally, remember that the goal is to use the language rather than collecting words or rules of the language
