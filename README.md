## 625 words

Currently, we are trying to create a data base with the translations of the 625 meaningful words most commonly used, and we are starting with the translation to Portuguese.

The data set contains the translation and the links to the images, the images are stored in the file for the media and the names of these images must match those in the data set.

## Things to do

- Improve the images
- Deal with missing images and words with different meanings
- Link the names of the images in the data set with the images in the media file
- Check that the Spanish translation is right, and then check the translation to Portuguese (from Spanish and/or English)
