# languages_anki

This is a repo to create decks for languages using Anki.

## 625 words

Currently, we are trying to create a data base with the translations of the 625 meaningful words most commonly used, and we are starting with the translation to Portuguese.

The data set contains the translation and the links to the images, the images are stored in the file for the media and the names of these images must match those in the data set.

## Things to do

- Improve the images
- Deal with missing images and words with different meanings
- Link the names of the images in the data set with the images in the media file
- Check that the Spanish translation is right, and then check the translation to Portuguese (from Spanish and/or English)
- Compare the original list of words with the data set and fix the problems (e.g. similar words like "speak/say")

## General plan

1. Create flashcards for basic vocabulary (625 words)
2. Learn some of basic grammar (probably without Anki)
3. Create flashcards for sentences
4. Improve what you want: more vocabulary, read audio books, write, watch videos or movies, speak, etc.
