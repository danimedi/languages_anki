# languages_anki

This is a repo to create decks for languages using Anki.

## 625 words

Data base with the translations of the 625 meaningful words most commonly used (there actually less than 625 words), it includes images (+ file with the images) and translations to Spanish and Portuguese.

## decks_json

It includes json files (currently 1) with the info for the Anki deck, created using the add-on "CrowdAnki".

> This file does NOT include media, so it should be downloaded from the media file (file with the images)

## Things to do

- Check that the Spanish translation is right, and then check the translation to Portuguese (from Spanish and/or English)
- Deal with numbers like 22, 34, 41, etc.
- Include images for numbers like third, fourth, etc.
- Improve the file system (sort the files, e.g. decide if using one or more files for the media)
- Improve the images
- Deal with missing images and words with different meanings
- Think about including audio files (remember that other option is using a TTS engine in the computer)
- Create / update the data set directly from changes in the decks (maybe using AnkiConnect add-on to generate the data set with code)

## General plan

1. Create flashcards for basic vocabulary (625 words)
2. Learn some of basic grammar (probably without Anki)
3. Create sentence cards
3. Create flashcards for sentences
4. Improve what you want: more vocabulary, read audio books, write, watch videos or movies, speak, etc. Finally, remember that the goal is to use the language rather than collecting words or rules of the language
